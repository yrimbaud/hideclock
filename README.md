# HideClock

A lightweight macOS menu bar utility that covers the system clock with a customizable overlay.

## Why HideClock?

Sometimes the clock is a distraction. Maybe you're trying to focus, giving a presentation, or simply prefer not to see the time constantly. HideClock sits quietly in your menu bar area, covering the system clock with whatever you choose: a solid color, the current time in a different format, a countdown timer, or your own custom text.

## Features

1) Overlay customization lets you adjust the width, height, background color, and position of the overlay to perfectly cover your menu bar clock.

2) Multiple display modes include showing nothing (just the colored overlay), the current time with seconds, custom text of your choice, or a countdown timer in minutes or seconds.

3) Flexible scheduling offers several ways to control when the overlay is visible. You can keep it always on, set a specific daily time range, configure different schedules for each day of the week, or set a duration from the current moment.

4) Smart behavior options include hiding the overlay automatically when your mouse approaches it, with configurable detection distance.

5) Persistence** ensures your countdown timer remembers where it left off if you quit and relaunch the app.

## Installation

Download the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/yrimbaud/HideClock/releases) page, open it, and drag HideClock to your Applications folder. On first launch, you may need to right-click and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper.

## Usage

Launch HideClock and a settings window will appear. The app runs in the background without a dock icon. To access settings again, simply relaunch the app from your Applications folder.

The settings are organized into four tabs:

1) General contains the main enable/disable toggle, overlay dimensions, mouse proximity behavior, and the option to launch at startup.

2) Appearance lets you choose the overlay background color, text color, opacity, font size, and vertical text offset.

3) Schedule controls when the overlay is visible. Choose between always-on, a daily time range, a weekly schedule with per-day configuration, or a countdown duration.

4) Content determines what appears on the overlay: nothing, the current time, custom text, or a countdown timer.
